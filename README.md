# Iris-flower-classification-ML
<b> Problem Statement </b>
The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately categorize various species of iris flowers.

Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project contains samples of three different iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Each species has 50 samples. The dataset includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, all measured in centimeters. Fisher developed a linear discriminant model using these four features to distinguish between the species.

Columns:

1. sepal_length
2. sepal_width
3. petal_length
4. petal_width
5. species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica)
   
# Models Used
1. Decision Tree Classifier Model - Accuracy: 100%
2. Random Forest Classifier Model - Accuracy: 96.67%
